## Company Background

Born in the heart of Motor City, AutoRevive Parts was founded by a group of automotive engineers who were passionate about keeping cars on the road. They offered a massive catalog of high-quality aftermarket parts and accessories, from brake pads to performance air filters. For years, they had leveraged the power of Amazon FBA to reach a national audience of DIY mechanics and professional repair shops.

Their business was built on volume and efficiency. They were experts at sourcing and selling auto parts, but they were not experts at navigating the Byzantine complexities of the Amazon FBA system. And it was costing them dearly.

## The Challenge: The Slow Bleed of FBA Errors

In early 2023, AutoRevive Parts was facing a silent killer: a slow, steady bleed of profits caused by a thousand tiny cuts from the Amazon FBA system.

*   **The Black Hole of Lost Inventory:** Amazon warehouses are massive, chaotic places. Inventory gets lost, damaged, or miscounted. AutoRevive knew this was happening, but they had no systematic way to track these discrepancies and file for the reimbursements they were owed.

*   **The Mystery of FBA Fees:** Their FBA fee statements were a confusing mess of acronyms and ever-changing charges. They were constantly being overcharged for storage, weight, and dimensions, but they lacked the time and expertise to fight back.

*   **The Chaos of Customer Returns:** Their returns process was a disaster. Customer-damaged items were being put back into their sellable inventory, and they weren’t getting reimbursed for items that were returned in a different condition than they were sent.

*   **A Reactive and Overwhelmed Team:** Their internal team was spending hours every week trying to track down FBA errors, but it was like playing a game of whack-a-mole. For every error they found, ten more would pop up.

## Our Comprehensive Approach: A Forensic FBA Audit and Recovery System

TrueLeafTech implemented a comprehensive FBA reimbursement and optimization service, a system designed to find and recover every single dollar that AutoRevive was owed.

### 1. The Deep Dive: A Forensic Audit

Our first step was to conduct a deep, 18-month look-back audit of their entire FBA account. Our proprietary software, combined with our team of expert analysts, scoured millions of lines of data, looking for every possible discrepancy. We identified missed reimbursements for lost and damaged inventory, customer return errors, and a host of FBA fee overcharges.

### 2. The Relentless Pursuit: Claim Management

We then took over the entire claims process. For every discrepancy we found, we opened a case with Amazon, providing them with the detailed documentation and evidence they needed to approve the claim. Our team is relentless; we follow up on every case, every day, until it is resolved and the money is back in our client’s account.

### 3. The Prevention: Proactive Fee Management

Recovery is only half the battle. We also put in place a system to prevent future errors. We conducted a full audit of their product catalog, correcting inaccurate weights and dimensions that were leading to overcharges. We also implemented a continuous monitoring system that flags potential fee errors in real-time, allowing us to address them before they impact the bottom line.

## Transformative Results: A Tsunami of Cash

The results of our FBA audit and recovery service were nothing short of astounding.

*   **A $1.2 Million Windfall:** Over the course of 18 months, we recovered over **$1.2 million** in FBA reimbursements for AutoRevive Parts. This was money that was rightfully theirs, but that they would have never seen without our help.

*   **A 95% Reduction in Fee Errors:** Our proactive fee management system led to a **95% reduction in FBA fee errors**, saving them tens of thousands of dollars every month.

*   **A 15% Boost in Profitability:** The combination of recovered funds and reduced fees led to a **15% increase in their overall profit margin** on Amazon.

*   **A Re-energized Team:** By taking the burden of FBA management off their plate, we freed up their internal team to focus on what they do best: growing their business.
