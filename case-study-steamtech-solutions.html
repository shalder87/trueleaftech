                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>SteamTech Solutions, a startup in the home appliance sector, launched an innovative handheld steaming device with ambitious goals for rapid e-commerce expansion across both direct-to-consumer (DTC) and major retail channels. Their product, designed for convenience and efficiency, quickly gained traction, but its success brought forth significant operational hurdles.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Despite a promising product, SteamTech Solutions faced critical challenges inherent to scaling a hardware business in the e-commerce landscape:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inexperienced in Hardware Supply Chains:</strong> Lacked the specialized knowledge and infrastructure to manage the complexities of manufacturing, importing, and distributing physical goods at scale.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inventory Storage & Management:</strong> Struggled with efficient warehousing, inventory tracking, and optimizing stock levels to meet fluctuating demand without incurring excessive costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Order Processing & Fulfillment:</strong> Manual or inefficient order processing led to delays, errors, and customer dissatisfaction, hindering their ability to scale.</li>
                        <li><strong>Returns Management:</strong> Inefficient handling of product returns resulted in lost revenue, increased operational costs, and missed opportunities to recover value from returned goods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scaling for Seasonal Demands & Retail Partnerships:</strong> The existing setup could not adequately handle peak seasonal demands or the stringent logistical requirements of major retail partners, limiting growth potential.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
